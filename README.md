# API Documentation

####  Backend deployed at [Heroku](production: https://production-lambda-synaps-be.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run start** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

### Backend framework goes here

Node:  Express, Postgres

- Node.js - We chose this to improve the efficiency and overall developer productivity. This is also excellent use for code sharing and reusability. Even greater benefits are the speed and the performance thanks to Node. With this we use the Express.js to allow us to build the app in the most efficient way.

}
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

üö´ This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` --> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
  
 _ STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
_ NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
_ JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;_(-_=+)') for i in range(50)])
_ SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account \* stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
